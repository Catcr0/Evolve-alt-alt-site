Added fasting scenario.
Fasting scenario details:
 * all food generation is 0
 * all methods of obtaining food is invalid. Including trading, replicator, anthropophagite, unfathomable cattle, etc.
 * Food tooltip has -100% penalty due to the scenario
 * All buildings that cost food to run are disabled and won't function at all, though they are still able to be built.
   * Space stations and embassy are exceptions to this as they were deemed required to progress. The food upkeep was removed from their tooltip for the challenge.
 * The first habitat costs no adamantite in order to be able to progress in alpha centauri without starports
 * Starvation reworked: Instead of being dependent on food consumption compared to food production and starvation threshold
   it is now based on citizen count, starvation threshold and food consumption modifiers
   The exact formula is x = (citizens) / 100 * (food consumption modifier) - (threshold)
   where x is the amount of citizens that starve each fastLoop instance (250ms by default). For the remainder, a random chance of an extra citizen starving is made.
   starvation still happens randomly 10% each loop like normal.
 * Added new basic job: Meditator. Each Meditator raises the starvation threshold and population growth value by +0.03 and +0.15 respectively. (affected by high population)
Added new achievement: endless hunger
 * endless hunger progress happens during the fasting scenario. It works similar to banana republic, where you have multiple tasks that can each be done in any order.
 * The tasks are as follows:
   * Construct the embassy
   * Build 80 stock exchanges
   * Reduce piracy to 0 in the Chtonian system
   * Reach 1200 citizens
   * Reach floor 50 in the spire
 * Once all tasks are done, the scenario is considered completed.
Added new feat: Secret to Immortality
 * Obtained by performing a demonic infusion reset during the fasting scenario without letting anyone starve
Added new perk: Endless hunger
 * This perk is linked to the endless hunger achievement.
 * This perk allows you to research a new tech. Banquet.
   * Banquet becomes available after researching electricity and costs 18500 science
 * Once researched, you gain access to building a new building. The banquet hall
 * You can build the banquet once for every rank of the perk you have.
 * You can enable or disable the banquet hall to enable its effect.
 * The effects of the banquet hall are as follows
   * Each in-game-day. (5s by default). Banquet strength raises by 1
   * Banquet strength raises food consumption but provides various bonuses.
   * Bonus count depends on the amount of banquet halls built.
     * 1 banquet hall: food consumption increase (1.022^strength)%
     * 1 banquet hall: citizen growth (strength^0.75)%
     * 2 banquet halls: soldier healing (strength^0.65)%
     * 3 banquet halls: soldier strength (strength^0.65)%
     * 4 banquet halls: luxury goods value (strength^0.7)%
     * 5 banquet halls: food consumption scales slower (^1.02 instead of ^1.022)
   * Banquet hall cost changes with each building built.
     * The first banquet hall costs  45,000 money,     40,000 food and 16,000 brick
     * The second banquet hall costs 180,000 money,    124,000 food,   42,000 brick and 46,000 wrought iron
     * The third banquet hall costs  2,400,000 money,  300,000 food,   110,000 brick,   88,000 wrought iron and 80,000 iridium
     * The fourth banquet hall costs 30,000,000 money, 720,000 food,   0 brick,         144,000 wrought iron,   220,000 iridium and 250,000 aerogel
     * The fifth banquet hall costs  90,000,000 money, 1,200,000 food, 0 brick,         240,000 wrought iron,   500,000 iridium,    1,440,000 aerogel and 600,000 bolognium
     * no more than five banquet halls can be bought.
   * banquet hall strength is reset when
     * the banquet hall is disabled
     * when food is about to hit 0
   * after resetting, banquet strength will continue to increase each day as long as it is enabled
 * general changes
   * made hunger penalty work correctly for luxury goods (penalty was directly applied to money production in the tooltip but didn't actually apply the penalty)
   * added hunger penalty indicator to money production tooltip
   * added correct hunger scaling to tax money so it doesn't always reduce income by 50% regardless of hunger modifiers like angry.
